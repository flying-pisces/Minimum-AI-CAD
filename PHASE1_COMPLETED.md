  - Orientation: "vertically", "horizontal alignment", "parallel"
  - Connection: "mount together", "bolt connection", "weld joint"

### M1.4 - Template-Based Connector Generation ✅
- **Smart Template Selection**: Based on distance, orientation, and part geometry
- **5 Connector Types**: Direct mount, L-bracket, spacer, vertical post, horizontal beam
- **Parametric Sizing**: Connector dimensions scale with requirements
- **Material Assignment**: Aluminum, steel, aluminum extrusion based on type
- **Mounting Points**: Bolt holes, threaded holes with proper spacing
- **Assembly Positioning**: Accurate part positioning to meet constraints

**Implementation Details:**
- `generate_connector_template()`: Template-based connector generation
- **Templates Available**:
  - `direct_mount`: <20mm distances, bolted connections
  - `bracket`: 20-50mm, L-bracket with reinforcement ribs
  - `spacer`: 50-100mm, spacer blocks with threaded bores
  - `vertical_post`: Vertical mounting with base plate

- **Interactive Preview**: Mouse controls, zoom, rotation
- **Real-time Status**: Processing indicators and completion status
- **Constraint Visualization**: Distance lines and constraint indicators
- **Export Options**: STEP, STL, OBJ format support (mock implementation)
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing time display
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and status indicators

**Implementation Details:**
- `AssemblyViewer.tsx`: Advanced Three.js assembly visualization
- `AssemblyStatus.tsx`: Enhanced status component with preview integration
- **Features**: Part coloring, connector highlighting, constraint visualization
- **Export**: Mock file generation with proper MIME types
